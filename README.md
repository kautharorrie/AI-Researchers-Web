# AI-Researchers-Web

This project focused on the creation of a knowledge graph that can be queried (with various filters, or 
combinations of filters by an end-user) to yield insights of varying depth into the Artificial Intelligence 
research ecosystem in South Africa. 
To this end, we have implemented a minimalist web application that enables users to interface with a 
graph database easily and intuitively, by abstracting complex functionality away from the user interface. 
Several categories of entities were identified as having importance to understanding the AI research 
environment, including researchers, research institutions, and other bodies of research, and 
specialisations within the field. These entities have been brought into effect as nodes within the 
knowledge graph, with their relationships shown as edges/vertices. 
This has been accomplished through the use of several frameworks. The creation of an underlying graph 
database was achieved by using the Stardog graph database management software. The Python-based 
Flask framework was utilized for UI design, while the front- and back-end were integrated with the use 
of Python in an object-oriented style. This knowledge graph ultimately enables users to visualize data, 
including specifically queried data and relationships, in order to analyze trends in one of the fastest
evolving fields of study being pursued currently.
